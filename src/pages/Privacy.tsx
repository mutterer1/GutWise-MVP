              <p className="mb-3">
                GutWise is a personal gut-health intelligence tool. We built it to be private-first. Your health data is yours - we do not sell it, profile you for advertisers, or share it beyond what is necessary to run the service.
              </p>
              <p>
                This policy explains what we collect, why, and what you can do with your data. If anything is unclear, reach out. We will always try to give you a straight answer.

              <p className="mb-3">We collect only what is needed to run GutWise:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1.5">
                <li>Account credentials — email address and a hashed password</li>
                <li>Health logs you choose to enter — bowel movements, symptoms, food, hydration, sleep, stress, medications, and menstrual cycle data</li>
                <li>Optional profile information such as age range and diagnosed conditions, used solely to personalise your insights</li>
                <li>Basic technical information — browser type and session data, used only for platform security and reliability</li>
              </ul>

                We do not collect location data beyond what you choose to enter. We do not use third-party advertising trackers.

              <p className="mb-3">
                Your data is stored on infrastructure provided by Supabase, which uses encryption at rest and in transit. Access to your data is restricted to your account through row-level security controls.
              </p>
              <p>
                No security measure is absolute. We are committed to acting promptly and transparently if a breach occurs.

                We use a small number of trusted third-party providers to operate GutWise — including database infrastructure and AI inference. These providers process your data only as instructed by us and are not permitted to use it for their own purposes.
              </p>
              <p>
                We do not sell your personal or health data to any third party.
